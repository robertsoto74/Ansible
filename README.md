# Ansible
To install Ansible, you will need the following:

Operating System: Ansible is compatible with various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Ensure that you have a supported operating system installed.

Python: Ansible requires Python to be installed on your system. Ansible supports Python 3.6 or higher. Check if Python is already installed by running python3 --version in your terminal or command prompt. If Python is not installed, you will need to install it before proceeding.

Package Manager (for Linux-based systems): On Linux-based systems, you will need a package manager to install Ansible dependencies. Common package managers include apt for Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu) and yum for Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS). Ensure that your package manager is installed and updated before installing Ansible.

Pip (Python Package Installer): Pip is the package installer for Python. It is used to install Ansible and its dependencies. Check if Pip is installed by running pip --version in your terminal or command prompt. If Pip is not installed, you will need to install it before proceeding.

Once you have ensured that your system meets these requirements, you can proceed with installing Ansible by following the instructions provided earlier.
